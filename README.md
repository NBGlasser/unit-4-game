# unit-4-game
## What was I supposed to be doing?
For this assignment I made my own take on the Crystal Collector game shown in the example

## Technologies used:
* HTML
* JQuery
* JavaScript
* CSS

## What I did:
After building the basic structure of the game in HTML, the first thing I did in JavaScript was defining variables for wins losses and points, which were set to zero; and the four images and the target, which were assigned random numbers. I then used JQuery so that when each image was clicked it would increment the points by however much the value it randomly had was. I then made logic in javascript stating that if the target was hit, wins would increase and if it was overshot, losses would increase and both would entirely reset the game. After that I styled the page to be a weird golf variant because I thought golf is somewhat similar to the crystal collector game in that you want to precisely land on your target and not surpass it.

## Problems I Encountered
I put all my random numbers in an array to start off so the game didn't work and I forgot to keep the html completely updated alongside the javascript logic while incrementing.
